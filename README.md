# Atomi

Reusable automation tools for atomistic modeling on HPC systems.

This repository is meant to collect scripts for:

- preparing calculations
- writing scheduler scripts
- submitting and tracking jobs
- post-processing outputs
- moving data between project folders and shared storage
- standardizing workflows across VASP, CP2K, LAMMPS, Turbomole, and OpenMolcas

## Install

For active development:

```bash
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd atomi
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,materials]"
```

For use on an HPC system:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git
```

If the compute environment has no internet access, install on a login node or build a wheel:

```bash
python -m pip wheel . -w dist
python -m pip install dist/atomi-*.whl
```

## Command Line

After installation, the main command is:

```bash
atomi --help
```

Examples:

```bash
atomi init-project my_vasp_run --code vasp
atomi write-submit --scheduler slurm --profile generic_cpu
atomi inspect .
```

## Recommended Migration Pattern

1. Put reusable Python logic under `src/atomi/`.
2. Put command-line interfaces under `src/atomi/cli/`.
3. Put code-specific logic under `src/atomi/codes/`.
4. Keep bash scripts only when they truly need shell behavior.
5. Put cluster-specific settings in YAML profiles instead of hard-coding paths.
6. Add one small test whenever you migrate an important script.

See `docs/migration.md` for a fuller plan.
